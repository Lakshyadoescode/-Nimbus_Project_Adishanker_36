# projectwarehouse
A C program that simulates warehouse order picking optimization using batching and routing. Orders are grouped by weight/item limits, and pick paths are generated using Manhattan distance with a nearest-neighbor heuristic. Demonstrates structs, pointers, dynamic memory, and efficient path planning.
